20,29594,dolibarr,https://github.com/Dolibarr/dolibarr/issues/29594,REST API PUT `/contacts/{id}`: `update` called with notrigger = 1," Bug Currently, the API endpoint for contact update bypasses triggers (notrigger = 1). The same is true for some other PUT endpoints (~~thirdparty for instance~~), but not all (contract, BOM, proposal, anything made with ModuleBuilder, etc.). **[edit]** I was wrong about `thirdparty` because Societe::update's 3rd parameter is `$call_trigger` and not `$notrigger` as is usually the case. So the 3rd parameter is `1` but it _does_ call the trigger. If the endpoint `PUT /contacts/{id}` was copy-pasted from the third party API, it could explain this issue because this detail is easy to overlook (I'm a good example of that). I assume this is on purpose, but I can't find the reason why, and it is inconsinstent (why notrigger for updating and not for creating, why some objects and not others). We are developing a feature using triggers to change information whenever a contact is created or updated, but because of this `notrigger`, we can't make it work in APIs.
